// Startup / cold-first-request profiler for zhtw-mcp.
//
// Not a criterion benchmark: cold-start is a once-per-process event. Criterion
// runs many iterations, so its lazy statics (grammar AC, zhtype char tables,
// clue index) are warm after iteration 1 -- it structurally cannot see the cold
// cost. This binary measures each phase exactly once, in order:
//
//   ruleset_load  postcard deserialize of the embedded artifact
//   scanner_build Aho-Corasick + segmenter construction (what Server::new does)
//   [server ready = load + build]
//   first_scan    first tools/call scan -- pays lazy init of grammar AC etc.
//   warm_scan     steady-state scan (min of a few iters)
//   [cold overhead = first_scan - warm_scan]
//   s2t_build     CLI only, and only for Simplified input
//
// Run: cargo run --release --bench startup
//
// The 50ms cold-start budget is checked against "server ready + first_scan";
// above it, prewarming the lazy first-hit structures during init pays off.
//
// Both budgets exit non-zero when missed. They print as well, but printing was
// all the earlier version did, and that is how a 15ms reported startup sat
// green next to a 180ms real invocation: the s2t converter was built eagerly by
// the CLI and never measured here. Measure what the caller pays, and fail.
